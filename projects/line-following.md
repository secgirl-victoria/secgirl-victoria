# 🚗 Keystudio 4WD Robot – Line Following

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focused on programming the Keystudio 4WD robot to follow a black line on a white surface using infrared sensors. It demonstrated concepts in control systems and basic automation.

## 🛠️ Tools & Components Used

- Keystudio 4WD robot kit
- Infrared line tracking sensors
- Arduino UNO board
- Motor driver module (L298N)
- Arduino IDE for programming
- Black tape on white surface for track simulation

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Build and code a robot that can follow a predefined path by detecting a black line on the ground using infrared sensors.

## 💡 Approach

1. Assembled the 4WD robot using the Keystudio kit.
2. Mounted infrared sensors underneath the robot.
3. Wrote an Arduino program to:
   - Continuously read sensor values.
   - Keep the robot centered on the black line.
   - Adjust motor speeds to turn left or right when drifting off the path.
4. Used simple conditional logic to maintain alignment with the path.
