# 🤖 Keystudio 4WD Robot – Obstacle Avoidance

## 📌 Project Overview

This project involved building and programming a Keystudio 4WD robotic car to detect and avoid obstacles using ultrasonic sensors. The aim was to demonstrate autonomous decision-making using basic robotics and embedded programming.

## 🛠️ Tools & Components Used

- Keystudio 4WD robot kit
- Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
- Arduino UNO board
- Motor driver module (L298N)
- Jumper wires and battery pack
- Arduino IDE for programming

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Design and program a robot that can autonomously navigate an area by detecting obstacles in its path and choosing the best alternative direction (left, right, or reverse).

## 💡 Approach

1. Assembled the 4WD car using the Keystudio kit.
2. Connected the ultrasonic sensor to detect distances ahead of the car.
3. Programmed the robot using Arduino IDE to:
   - Move forward when the path is clear
   - Stop and check left and right distances when an obstacle is detected
   - Turn to the direction with more free space
4. Used conditional logic and distance thresholds to make decisions in real time.
